# Here's a class representing Batman, the protector of Gotham.
# This call uses the standard constructor (no parameters) and
# has a method intimidate_villain that doesn't take any
# parameters. This class is already created, you do NOT need to
# create it.

# Your task, on the other hand, is to create an instance of the
# class Batman and call the method intimidate_villain. DO NOT
# print anything.

# create a Batman here
Bat = Batman()
