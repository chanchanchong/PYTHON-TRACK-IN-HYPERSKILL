Theory: Float

In the old days of web development, when there were no
flexbox and grid properties for creating layouts, the
float property was widely used. The reason float
became so common was because block-level elements
are aligned in columns by default, and float was the
easiest way to change their positions: Nowadays, we have
other tools to create layouts, but float is still useful in
certain situations.

In this topic, you will learn how to use the float
property and when it should be used.


1. What is float used for?
The float property is commonly used when we want a
block of text to flow around an image or want an element
to stand next to another element. Some web developers
even use it to create layouts, but properties like CSS
flexbox can do this more efficiently.

With the float property defined, an element can be
pushed to the left or right, thus allowing the next element
on the webpage (or the next element in the flow) to float
around it. Float is useful in these situations because no
other CSS property can achieve the same result.

To work with float, we first need a container. In other
words, the element we want to float needs to be
contained within a parent element. Neither the element
we want to float or its parent element can have their
position set to absolute because elements with this
setting are removed from the flow of the webpage.

The values we can use with the float property are as
follows:
- left: The element will float to the left side of its
  parent.
- right: The element will float to the right side of its
  parent.
- inherit: The element will inherit the float value
  from its parent.

2. Normal flow
First, let's look at an example where the float property
could be used:

<div class="main-container">
    <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/08/05/11/16/logo-2582747_1280.png" alt="CSS Logo">
    <p>The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container...</p>
</div>

        A red border has been added to our container to
        make the behavior of our elements clearer.

Notice that without float applied, the text is below the image. This occurs because the two
elements are in the webpage's normal flow and are positioned in a column by default.
