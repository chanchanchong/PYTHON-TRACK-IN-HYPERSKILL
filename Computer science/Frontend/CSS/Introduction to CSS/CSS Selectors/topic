Theory: CSS Selectors

A selector points to an element to which
styles will be applied.

CSS technology does not limit you to using only a single
selector: you can use multiple! There are several basic types
that allow us to flexibly change the appearance of web pages. In
this topic, you will about some of these basic CSS
selectors.

1. CSS element Selector
CSS element Selectors are the most elementary and easy-to-
use selectors. Their essence is the following: you use the name
of the HTML element to which you want to apply the style as
the selector.

At the same time, if there are several elements in the layout of
your web page indicated by this tag, then styles will be applied
to all of them. Let's see what it looks like in the following
example:

p {
    color: brown;
}

Their CSS code tells you that the text in all paragraphs will be
brown-colored. We apply it to an HTML document that contains
the following lines:

<p>The color of the text of this paragraph will become the color of brown.</p>
<p>And this.</p>
<p>And this too.</p>

The resulting page will look like this:

As you can see, the style is applied to all HTML elements p on
the web page.


2. CSS id Selector
CSS id Selector is used to if you need to work with a specific
element when there are many similar elements. It takes its
name from the value of the id attribute of the HTML tag you
need. A symbol # is placed in front of it so that the browser
understands that this is an id selector.

For example, let's select the first paragraph on the page and
increase its font. Here's the CSS code:

#big {
    font-size: 30px;
}

And this is the HTML code:
<p id="big">The text of this paragraph will change</p>
<p>This one won't change size.</p>
<p>This one won't either.</p>

In the browser, our page will look like this:

The styles were applied only to the HTML tag with the id
attribute.

3. CSS class Selector
CSS class Selector is useful when you need to give a lot of
different elements the same look. The name of the selector is
taken from the value of the class attribute of the desired
HTML tag. A dot . is placed in front of it so that the browser
understands that this is a class selector.

Let's consider an example: say we want to apply the same
background color (blue) to several different elements.

Here's how the CSS code will look like:
.blue {
    background-color: blue;
}

And here's an example of the HTML code:
<h1 class="blue">The background color of this element should be blue.</h1>
<p> class="blue">This too.</p>
<p>And this one will remain without a beautiful background.</p>

In the browser, our page will look like this:

The styles were applied only to the HTML tags with the class
attribute.

As you can see, the selectors open up a variety of possibilities
to design your web page content. We can honestly say that
selectors are among the most important elements of CSS.
