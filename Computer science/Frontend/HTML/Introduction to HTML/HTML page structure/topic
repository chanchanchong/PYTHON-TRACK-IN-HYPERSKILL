Theory: HTML page structure

Programming is not as mechanical and alien as it may seem:
in many aspects, it is similar to the human world. This is
very easy to notice if you look at the structure of HTML
pages, which contains elements like <head> and <body>.
Making a site is thus a process of creation, and as a creator,
you need to be familiar with all the necessary building
blocks. There is a lot to learn, but any lot starts with the
essential basics: please welcome on stage, HTML tags.

1. Basic tags in HTML
Among numerous HTML tags that form the logical structure
of a page, some are considered the base. The structure can
be divided into three main sections: <html>, <head> and
<body>.

Take a look at the code of a simple HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Page title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    </body>
</html>

If you save this code in the HTML format (.html) and open it
in your browser, the page will look like this:

This looks quite basic, but with HTML you can do much
more: customize the structure of the text, manage its visual
presentation, and display paragraphs, forms, pictures, titles,
and tables. Hypertext markup language allows you to format
texts, which makes them friendlier to Internet users. It is
much more convenient to read the text that has clear and
logical markup rather than plow through unstructured text.

Let's get back to the code from the previous example and
consider the listed tags in more detail.
- element <!DOCTYPE> specifies the type of the current
  document: DTD (Document Type Definition). It is
  necessary that the browser understands according to
  which HTML standard to display the web page. As you
  see, this is one of the tags that aren't paired;
- the <meta> tag with attribute charset specifies
  document encoding. If it is not specified, some
  browsers may display obscure characters instead of
  the text;
- the <html> tag indicates that it is an HTML document;
- the <head> tag is designed to store elements that help
  the browser and search engines to work with data;
- the <title> contains the HTML document header.
  Even though this tag is not mandatory, it is till present
  on almost all web pages on the Internet;
- the <body> tag defines the page content area. It wraps
  the content displayed in the main browser window;
- the <h1> tag holds the page title within the body, and
  the <p> tag is responsible for the paragraphs. These
  tags are not the main sections and provided here as an
  example, but you're likely to find them useful in the
  future as you move from basic to artsy.

2. Basic HTML Page Structure
Here is a visualization of the basic HTML page structure:

As you can see, this structure bears a resemblance to our
anatomy. Hopefully, this analogy will help you understand
HTML better.

3. Conclusion
Surely, both humans and web pages are much more complex
and show a lot of variation. Modern pages can be very large
and may contain a lot of different tags inside <body>, but
their basic structure always remain the same. Com to
think of it, this is also so very human.
