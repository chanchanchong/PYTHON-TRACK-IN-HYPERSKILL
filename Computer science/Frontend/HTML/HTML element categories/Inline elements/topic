Theory: Inline Elements

For many beginners, HTML structure can pose a
challenge. Web page elements and their properties may
be very confusing. To get things straight, it it enough to
know the exact type of a particular web page element.

In HTML 4.01 or earlier, there are two main types of page
elements: block-level and inline. In HTML5, however, the
elements are not just divided into block-level and inline
types, they are also grouped by their meaning and
purpose, representing content categories. This concept
will be considered at length in the topics to come. For
now, try to understand the ins and outs of inline
elements.

Inline elements are elements of a document that
constitute an integral part of a line. They emphasize a
part of a text and give it a certain function or meaning.
They usually contain one or more words.

Let's now take a look at six examples of inline elements.

1. The <a> tag
The <a> tag is probably one of the most important HTML
elements. It's designed to create links. This tag is often
used with the href attribute that indicates the path to a
file/webpage. Consider a code snippet that takes us to
the JetBrains website:
<a href="https://jetbrains.com">Click here to access the JetBrains website!></a>

The text wrapped in the <a> tag is highlighted and
underlined. When you click on it, the link takes you to the
address specified in the href attribute.

2. The <span> tag
You can wrap a text or a part of it in the <span> tag:
<p>For the first time <span>on our site</span>?</p>
<span>Sign up now!</span>

This tag does not affect the text representation:

You may want to ask a question why do we need this tag?
The <span> tag is used when you need to change the
appearance of a text using CSS. CSS is the language that
describes the web page's appearance. The Web Developer
tracks cover this language; in the meantime, let's
continue with inline elements.

3. The <button> tag
To create a clickable button, use the <button> tag. You
can wrap something in this paired tag, and the text will be
displayed inside the button:

<button>Click</button>


4. The <b> tag
This paired tag makes any text bold. The limits of the text
are indicated by the <p> tag. In the example below, we
have changed the outline of the person name and
surname:

<p>I'm <b>John Doe</b>, and what's your name</p>

Now look at the result in the browser:

As you can see, this tag is very convenient and easy to
use when you want to highlight an important part of the
text.

5. The <sub> tag
Use this tag to create a subscript text. The text inside this
paired tag is scaled down and reduced in size. Let's see
how it works:

<p>The formula of water is H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

The result is the following:

This tag comes in handy when you need to write a
chemical formula.


6. The <sup> tag
This tag creates a superscript text. It is similar to the
previous tag we've covered, except that the text enclosed
in this tag is scaled up:

<p>x<sup>2</sup> = 4 </p>

With <sup>, you can display mathematical equations and
formulas on your web page.

This is by far not a complete of inline elements, as
there is definitely more to know.

7. Inline elements features
The following features are characteristic of all inline
elements:
- They can contain only data and other inline items.
  The only exception is the <a> tag that can also
  contain block-level elements.
- A browser doesn't make a line break before and
  after a tag. Take a look at the behavior of inline
  elements and compare it with that of block-level
  elements:
- Inline elements work only when they are enclosed in
  tags.


8. Conclusion
In this topic, we have covered a small portion of inline
elements. They are a great asset; you can do a lot of
things with them, from creating a link to displaying a
complex mathematical formula. It will take time to
memorize them all, so carry on and stay focused on the
practical side. Speaking of which, let's complete our code
challenges!
