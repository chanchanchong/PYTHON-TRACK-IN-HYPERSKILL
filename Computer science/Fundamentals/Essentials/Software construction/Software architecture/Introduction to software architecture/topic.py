# Theory: Introduction to software architecture

# At the beginning of a development cycle for a complex
# application that combines multiples components, you may
# notice that you need to have a proper structure that
# represents all interactions happening within. Software
# architecture is the term that defines said structure. IT
# helps understand the relationships between each major
# system component and simultaneously provides the
# necessary documentation for developers and clients.

# Every project that combines multiple different
# components has to have a clear software architecture to
# define technical and structural requirements for the
# system. It allows reducing any possible risk when
# creating a project. If you need to complete your project
# and establish communications within a team in a short
# amount of time, you need to master software
# architecture.

# 1. What is software architecture?
# For example, you want to develop a brand new
# application, that potentially could do whatever you want.
# What will be the first thing that you'll do? Your answer
# should be, "Divide my application into several
# components, write documentation and draw a scheme of
# all the connections within it".
