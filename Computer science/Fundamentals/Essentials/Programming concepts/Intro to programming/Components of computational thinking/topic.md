## Theory: Components of computational thinking

Computational thinking is a set f skills that helps you
come up with a generalizable solution to a problem and 
solve it using a computer.
Let's elaborate on the main foundations of this skills,
namely: **abstraction**, **decomposition**, **pattern recognition**,
and **evaluation**.

#### 1. Decomposition
Complex problems are easier to solve then when we break
them down into separate steps and subproblems. We do
this all the time in our daily life as well. For example, if
your goal is to make a pizza, you'd need to find a recipe,
shop for all the relevant ingredients, heat the over, make
the dough, chop the toppings, and finally bake the pizza
for an appropriate amount of time Breaking down a 
problem like that helps to focus on solving each
subproblem separately (and maybe even reusing
solutions other people came up with) and avoid being
overwhemled by the requirements.

#### 2. Extracting the Generalizing patterns
Once the problem is decomposed our next step would be
to look for patterns in the smaller subproblems. A pattern
is a set of features in a task that is shared among more
than one instance of the problem. For example, if you
need to cook Pepperoni pizza, you'd need to make a flat
pizza bottom. The bottom is a pattern shared among all
the pizzas, so you can generalize this pattern and if you
wish t later make Margherita you can reuse all the 
information and steps you took for preparing Pepperoni
pizza.

Pattern recognition is based on the five key steps:
- Identify common elements in problems or systems
- Identify and interpret common differences in
  problems or systems
- Identify individual elements within sub-problems
- Describe patterns that have been identified
- Make predictions based on identified patterns.

#### 3. Abstraction
Abstraction helps us generalize the solution by figuring
out a model of a situation. We get rid of all the 
unnecessary details to focus on what's actually
important. One can say that a programming language is
an abstraction. You use variables to perform operations
instead of listing all the data these variables stand for
every time. 

It's exactly the abstraction that helps us come up with a 
generalizable solution without writing a separate program
for each variation of the problem.

If we come back to pizza, and try to apply abstraction we 
would say that for pizza it needs flat dough,
sauce, and toppings.

The shape of the pizza and the fact that it has cheese
would be unnecessary details since it is possible to
imagine square pizza with no cheese.

Therefore if we abstract our pizza like a flat dough open
pie with toppings and sauce we would be able to write
one program to perform operations on all the pizzas, no
matter their taste, shape, and vegan friendliness.

#### 4. Evaluation
Once you found a solution to your problem it is helpful to
go through an evaluation checklist. At times your solution
won't work and this checklist can also help you to find out
where you've gone wrong.

Make sure your solution is:
- Easy to understand. Usually that is the case if the 
  problem is decomposed well.
- Complete. Your solution covers all the aspects of 
  the problem. Remember, the devil is in the corner
  cases.
- Efficient. Make sure you are making the best of the 
  tools you have, in case of programming it can regard
  using appropriate syntax constructions. Speed is
  one of the most important markers of the solution's
  efficiency and becomes incredibly important when
  writing production code.


#### 5. Conclusion
So, the approaches we've discussed here can be
summarized as breaking down a problem into separate
steps, looking for patterns in these small steps, making
an optimal model of a problem, and checking the final
solution. These concepts will help you develop a more
efficient and structured problem-solving process. After
all, the ability to solve problems is what distinguishes a 
programmer from a person who just knows a
programming language.
