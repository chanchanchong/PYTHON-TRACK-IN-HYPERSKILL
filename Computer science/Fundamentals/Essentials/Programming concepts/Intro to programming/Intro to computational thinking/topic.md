## Theory: Intro to computational thinking

A programming language allows us to explain to a 
computer how to execute a solution to a particular
problem in the real word. But first, a programmer has to
come up with the solutions, also using a skill necessary
for any type of programming no matter the language. It is 
called computational thinking.

#### 1. What is computational thinking?
Computer can only deal with clear, concise instructions
that agree with the rules of formal logic. However, real-
word problems are rarely cut so clearly. **Computational
thinking** is a set of mental skills helping to see the 
problems as a set of complex information processes that
we can transform into a particular set of instructions for a 
computer.

Approach every problem you encounter while learning a
programming language as not only the opportunity to
remember the syntax of the language but also as an
opportunity to train computational thinking.

To do that, you can follow a simple algorithm:
    1. **Describe the problem**
        What exactly needs to be done? What input data are
        you given and what does the desired outcome look
        like?
    2. **Identify the important details needed to solve this
        problem**
        Before thinking of a solution, make sure you take
        into account all the important aspects of the 
        problem. The devil is in the details, and in case of 
        programming, it hides in edge cases.
    3. **Decompose**
        Break the problem down into small, logical steps
        until you know exactly how to code each part of it.
    4. **Use these steps to create an algorithm that solves
        the problem**
        Connect the pieces of the problem in a way that
        would produce the desired outcome in all specified
        cases.
    5. **Evaluate the process**
        Usually, a problem has at least a few solutions, and 
        it's very useful to evaluate your idea to make sure
        you've chosen a way that is as efficient as possible.

#### 2. Conclusion
Since computational thinking is a skill, it requires lots of 
practice before you can easily apply it. Don't despair if
your only thought when looking at a problem is that you 
have no idea how to achieve the desired results. Use the 
algorithms we described and keep on breaking the
problem down until you see how to explain it to a 
computer with the tools of the programming language
you chose.
