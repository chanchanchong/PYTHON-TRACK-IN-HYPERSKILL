# Theory: Introduction to Linux

# Linux is a family of operating systems that use the Linux kernel.
# Widely spread, they provide many convenient tools for
# developers. Besides, Linux concepts became a source of
# inspiration for many ideas in programming languages.

# The mascot of the Linux is a penguin named Tux:

# The choice of this symbol was not coincidental. Linus Torvalds,
# the creator of the operating system's kernel, had a similar toy in
# his childhood.

# 1. A brief history of Linux
# Linus Torvalds, a Finnish software engineer, created the Linux
# kernel in 1991. He based his development on the UNIX operating
# system which was popular at that time among many
# organizations and scientific institutions.

# The first version of the kernel turned out to be very raw, with
# many deflects and errors, so Linus decided to publish the source
# code openly on the Internet. As a result, many people got
# interested in Torvalds' idea and took part in the development of
# Linux. They started sending their improvements and corrections
# to the bugs found in the code.

# 2. Distributions
# By itself, without software, the kernel is completely useless.
# However, it can be a basis for developing operating systems.
# Since the Linux kernel was posted free of charge, everyone
# could customize the system according to their needs and wants.
# Thus, it gave rise to the distributions. Distribution is one of the
# operating systems based on the Linux kernel with many pre-
# installed programs, sometimes with the Graphical User
# Interface (GUI) from the box. You have probably heard of some
# of them at least once: Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Archilinux,
# Gentoo. This is far from a complete list of all the existing
# distributions.

# Besides, have some specific knowledge, you can build your
# own distribution, both from scratch or on the basis of already
# existing projects.


# 3. Where and why people use Linux
# Linux is free, customizable, very reliable, and undemanding to
# resources. Thanks to the well-though-out file system, you can
# run distributions without a GUI. It also have extensive hardware
# support as all free Linux drivers are built into the kernel. The
# scope of Linux is vast, much larger than that of all other
# operating systems. It works perfectly on ordinary personal
# computers, as well as on servers, embedded systems, and
# network software. Most of the supercomputers in the world
# with with Linux, for example, CERN. Even Android OS is based
# on the Linux kernel.

# Such a large range of supported devices means excellent
# portability of programs. Often, we can run the same application
# on both an ordinary computer and a Linux-based smartphone
# with minimal effort.


# 4. Conclusion
# So you took the first step in studying Linux. You have learned its
# benefits and realized how, with community support, it becomes
# a major operating system on millions of devices.

# Linux can provide a modern, stable, multiuser, and multitasking
# environment that will cost you nothing. All you have to do is pick
# the right distribution and, if you wish, customize it to suit your
# needs.
