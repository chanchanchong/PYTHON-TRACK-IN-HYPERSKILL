# Theory: Algorithms in Python

# As you know, algorithms are language-independent, meaning
# that the same algorithm can be implemented in different
# programming languages. Since your goal is to learn Python, we
# will consider how to implement basic algorithms using this
# language and its features.

#  1. Implementing algorithms in Python
# Python has many libraries that provide ready-to-use functions
# for various problems. Algorithms are not an exception. You can
# find most of the widely-used algorithms in the Python standard
# library or in the external packages. Usually, an algorithm is a
# standalone function that may either be implemented directly in
# Python or represent a wrapper that calls a function written in
# another programming language.

# Python standard library contains such functions as sorted,
