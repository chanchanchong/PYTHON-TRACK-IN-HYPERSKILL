# Theory: Multi-line programs

# We hope you have already learned how to write simple Python
# programs consisting of a single line that just prints a text.
# However, real programs contain a significant number of lines:
# from tens and hundreds for small scripts to thousands and even
# more for large projects. So, in this lesson, you will write
# programs that print multiple lines.

# Let's consider an example, the following code prints exactly
# three strings, each on a new line:

# print("I")
# print("know")
# print("Python")
# The output is:

# I
# know
# Python
# You can run this example here or locally if you have already
# installed Python on your computer.

# There are other ways to print the same text using just one
# function call. We will consider them in the next topics.
#
# The print function also allows you to print an empty line with no
# string specified:

# print("I")
# print()
# print("know")
# print()
# print("Python")
# Here's the output:
#
# I
#
# know
#
# Python

# However, skipping the line will have no effect:

# print("And")
#
# print("you?")
# The output is:
#
# And
# you?
# Now it's time to solve some problems.
