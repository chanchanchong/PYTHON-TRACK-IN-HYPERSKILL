Theory: Introductio to JavaScript

These days, it is difficult to find sites that do not allow visitors
to interact with them. Think sliders, web galleries, animation
and whatever other interactive events that pop out when you
press some button. The processing of user input, the ability to 
send/receive data from servers and other interactive behavior
are provided by JavaScript.

1. What is JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is one of the most used programming
languages. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995, and it took
him ten days. You read it right: JavaScript was really developed
in just en days!

According to GitHub 2018, JS tops the list of the most popular
programming languages. It is used for both front-end and back-end
development.

	JavaScript is not Java. These are different progrmaming 
	languages. Their similar names were a marketing move to 
	draw attention to the new language and take advantage of
	the popularity of Java.

JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript standard (often
shortened to ES). The latest version of this standard is ES11.

2. The first program
Program written in this language are called scripts. Here is an
example of a simple JS scripts that prints I am starting to 
learn JavaScript!:

console.log("I am starting to learn JavaScirpt!");

All modern browsers have a built-in program that allows you to 
execute JS directly in them. Let's lok at the result of our first
program in the browser. To do this, press
Ctrl+Shift+J/Ctrl+Shift+K or Cmd+Opt+J/Cmd+Option+C on
Mac, write the JS code in the opened console, then press Enter.

console.log("I am starting to learn JavaScript!");
I am starting to learn JavaScript!

As you can see, the result of our first script was the line I am
starting to learn JavaScript!.

The browser console is not always easy to use, so you can also
run his code on this site.


3. Conclusion
JavaScript has a huge community of developers all over the
world. This programming language is easy to learn and pleasant
to write programs in. You will still come across difficulties, but
when you do, you can always ask other programmers for help or 
even find a ready-made answer!

There is a lot of new information in this topic, so we tried not to
bore you with the history of JavaScript creation. If you still want 
to read it, you can visit this page on Wikipedia and then
continue learning.
