Theory: Overview of the basic program

In this topic, you will learn how to develop first JS script.
These programs are quite simple yet functional, so they do a 
good job showing that programming in JavaScript is easy and
enjoyable. However, there are caveats and difficulties
everywhere, so we will look at some common programming
errors and how to avoid them.

1. Hello, World!
When learning any programming language, it is a kind of a 
tradition to start with writing a program that displays a message
"Hello, World!" on the screen or on another device. And who
are we to break traditions?

console.log("Hello, World!");

You may run this code: just copy it and click on the triangle. You
should get this result:

Hello, World!

As you can see, the script consists of one line and simply prints
the text passed in brackets. Note that the quotes are also
ignored when outputting the result. This code is very simple but
deserves a detailed review.


2. Explanation
Here console.log is a function. A function is a block of code
that performs useful work for you, such as printing text. In a 
way, a function is a subroutine that can be reused in your 
programs. When a function name is followed by parentheses, it 
means that it has been called to get the result. console.log
allows you to output information to the console, so this function
is often used to find errors in the code.

Moving on, "Hello, World!" is a string. All strings in JavaScript
are enclosed in single or double quotes, so "Hello, World!"
would also be a valid string. See for yourself - try to run the 
following code:

console.log("JavaScript");

The program will print:

JavaScript

3. Printing quotes
If you want to include quotes in a string, there are two ways to 
avoid confusion and successfully print them:
- You can quote this line in other types of quotes, for example:
