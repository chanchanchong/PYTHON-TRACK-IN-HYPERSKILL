## Theory: Cartesian coordinates

In this topic we will discuss the Cartesian coordinate
system, one way of graphing points in a 2D space. You
may have learned about it in school as the x - y plane,
so this topic will be more of a reminder.

#### 1. Cartesian coordinates on the plane
The **Cartesian coordinate system** is the most common
coordinate system. It's based on the idea of orthogonal
axes, meaning that you can travel in the direction of one
axis without affecting your position on the other. For
example, on a map, the north-south axis is orthogonal to
the east-west axis.

Let's see how it works on the plane. The Cartesian
coordinate system consists of a point __O__, whose
coordinates are __(0, 0)__, and two orthogonal axes, labeled
__x__ and __y__. The axes intersect at __o__ (for origin), making right
angles and dividing the plane into four symmetrical parts.

Every point on the plane is defined in relation to these
two axes, giving it coordinates: the **x**-coordinate and 
the **y**-coordinate. Each of these coordinates is a real
number. By convention, we write them in parentheses like
**(x, y)**, so the green point below with coordinates **x = 2**,
**y = 3** is labelled **(2, 3)**.

This figure demonstrates that each point can be 
considered as an **x** coordinate (horizontal dotted line)
plus a **y** coordinate (vertical dotted line) - including the
origin point __O__, for which each line has 0 length.
