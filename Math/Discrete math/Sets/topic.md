## Theory: Basics of sets

#### 1. What is a set?
Suppose we have a  collection of numbers: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5** or a 
grou0p of letters: **a, b, c, d, e**. In math, we cal this group **a set**.
So, simply put, it's **a collection of distinct elements**. For 
instance, a set of learners of programming, a set of learners of 
math, a set of book on the shelf, a set of people in the cafe, etc.
We use curly brackets *{}* to denote a set.

A **finite** set is a set that has a finite number of elements and a
**infinite** set is a set that is not finite set. For example.

** { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} **

- it is a finite set of integers from 1 to 5. We list each element
separated by a comma, and then put curly brackets around the 
whole thing. Another example:

** { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... } **

- it is an infinite set of natural numbers. The three dots are 
called **an ellipsis**. That means this set continues for infinity. But
sometimes we use the "..." in the middle to save writing long 
lists:

** {1, 2, 3, ..., 18, 19, 20}. **

In this case, the set is finite (there are only 20 integers).

Usually, we denote a set by capital letters and an element in 
that set by lowercase letters: ** A = {a, b, c, ...} ** - in this 
example **A** is a set, **a** is an element in **A**.

There are several ways we can define a set. For example, if 
**B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, we could write this as

** B = {x : 1 <= x <= 10 where x is an integer} **

It reads like this: "**B** is equal to the set of x such that x is 
greater or equal to 1, but less or equal to 10, where x is an
integer".

#### 2. Members of a set 
Objects in the set are called **members** or **elements** of a set. For 
example, 2 is an element of the set {1, 2, 3}, football is an
element of the set {tennis, football, hockey}. The symbol âˆˆ
shows that the element belongs to the given set, and
